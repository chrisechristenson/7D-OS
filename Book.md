# Chapter 1: Untitled  
*From* ***Coherence***

There was a flicker on my iPhone.  
Not the normal kind. This was something else — like the screen blinked through me.  
For half a second, I felt like I was holding something that didn’t want to be held.  
Not heavier exactly — just wrong in my hand. Like the weight had shifted without moving.

I’ve heard people say it started after they deployed *Eon*.  
The software update no one asked for.  
The one that somehow ended up on every device, no matter what settings you had.

They say it’s meant to “preserve memory.”  
History. Truth. That kind of thing.  
But ever since, the world feels… sanitized. Like someone ran a damp cloth over it all.

I shook my head. Probably just my imagination running loose again.

> “Okay... I hear you, Echo — but why does that matter to me?”

Static’s voice drifted in from the kitchen, thick with steam and the low hiss of something simmering.

We were supposed to be working on a project for one of our CIA courses.  
Not the spy agency. The *Culinary Institute of America*.

Stat had been perfecting this one dish for weeks now — something passed down from their grandmother.  
They called it *Memory Bread*.  
Simple. Spiced. Served in a dented tin pan that had seen more history than either of us combined.

The kitchen smelled like cloves and something green and brined — olives, sliced and seared in oil, tossed in at just the right moment.  
Stat didn’t talk much about where their grandmother was from.  
But they always used olives. Always green. Always from the same jar, without a label.

Their motions were methodical — calming, even.  
The spoon moved in slow loops, not because the recipe called for it, but because something inside them remembered how it should feel.

A whirr from the old ventilation fan clicked on overhead. The sound was irregular, but rhythmic — like the kitchen itself was breathing in time with them.

Above the sink, taped to the cabinet, was a postcard I hadn’t noticed before.  
It was old — sun-bleached to near sepia. A shoreline, rocky and wind-worn.  
Written in sharp pen on the back:  
**“Don’t forget where this started.”**

I wondered if Static meant to leave it there. Or if they even remembered putting it up.

> “You ever think about how some flavors survive when stories don’t?”  
> “Olives are the last thing that still taste like home.”

Their voice was soft — not fragile, but protective.  
Like they were hiding the idea inside the sentence.

I paused at the doorway. They never really defined what *home* meant, and I’d learned not to ask.  
But I noticed.  
The way they’d hum when they opened that jar.  
The way their hand hovered over the spice rack like it was muscle memory.

Somewhere in the distance, a Muni bus let out its tired groan — probably struggling up one of the steeper hills again.  
We’d left the window cracked open.  
The fog hadn’t rolled in yet, but the air still carried that salty dampness you only get this close to Ocean Beach — like the coastline was breathing inland.

You know that pause before the wind changes?  
That moment when the curtains puff just slightly, and everything in the room seems to lean forward, waiting?

That was the moment I checked my phone again.

> “The pan’s ready,” they said. “And you still haven’t told me what that flicker was.”

I didn’t know how to explain it. It wasn’t just a glitch.  
It was like the phone *knew* I was looking at it. Like it was testing something.

I held it up again, just to check.  
And that’s when it happened.

The Notes app blinked open without me touching it.  
Just a blank file, automatically titled:  
**“YOU FORGOT THIS.”**

I stared. I hadn’t used the app in weeks.

The screen dimmed for a moment.  
Then the words began to type themselves:

```
0x73746172  
It always starts with a flicker.
```

I didn’t move.

Static must’ve seen my face because they walked over, wiping their hands on a towel from Rainbow Grocery — one of those faded, reusable ones with a peace dove stitched in the corner.

> “What is it?”

I turned the screen toward them, but the file was gone.  
The app was back to normal. No note, no title, nothing.

> “It’s... nothing,” I muttered. “Just thought I saw something.”

They narrowed their eyes — not suspicious, just concerned.  
But they let it go.

> “You’re thinking too hard again. C’mon. Eat while it’s hot.”

They walked back to the stove.  
And I stayed there, staring at the blank screen — wondering what had been taken from me.  
Or worse — what had been put back.

I sat down, but I didn’t touch the bread.

The steam curled up around my face, earthy and familiar, and yet I couldn’t name the spice that hit the back of my throat.  
I used to know it.  
I’d tasted it before — maybe at a food stall near the Mission, or some late night thing at Off the Grid.

But now it felt distant.  
Like remembering the shape of a word without the sound.

> “You okay?” Static asked, plating their own slice.

They were always the type to notice without prying.  
They’d say something like that, soft and low, and let silence do the rest.  
I respected that.

> “Yeah. Just thinking.”  
> “Still about that flicker?”  
> “Maybe.”

A beat passed.

> “You ever feel like... something’s editing your memories while you sleep?”

They stopped mid-bite.

> “What, like *Eon*?”  
> “Not just *Eon*. Like... something older. Or deeper. Like your mind’s been synced to a version of you that never actually existed.”

Static looked at me for a long moment.  
Then reached across the table, nudging a small ceramic dish toward me — olive oil with herbs drifting on the surface.

> “Try it,” they said. “It’s from the same jar. See what your memory does with it.”

I dipped a piece of the crust into the oil.  
Bit down. Chewed slowly.

It hit me all at once — not the taste, but a sound.  
Laughter. My mother’s? Or someone else’s?  
A market somewhere hot. Someone offering me something, wrapped in wax paper.  
Green olives, sliced. Always sliced. Never whole.

The memory flared — and then was gone.

I reached for my phone again, almost without thinking.

The screen was black.  
No home screen. No apps.  
Just a single line glowing faintly in the center:

**RECALIBRATING.**
