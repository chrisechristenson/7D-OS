# 7D OS — Symbolic Dimensional Core

This module defines the 7 foundational dimensions of the 7D Operating System:
- Each dimension has a symbol, function, and polarity
- Used as the base layer for reflection scoring, elemental alignment, and quest design

> "The map is not the territory — but the symbol *is* the mirror."
